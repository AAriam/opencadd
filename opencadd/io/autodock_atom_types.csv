# List of AutoDock-defined atom types and their properties.
# These atom types are used in AutoDock software (e.g. AutoGrid4) and file formats (e.g. PDBQT)
# An official documentation could not be found; the list is taken from below link:
# https://mmb.irbbarcelona.org/gitlab/BioExcel/structureChecking/blob/5f07d82dc36d1f43733ae3b1ecd9f40aebe8b0a2/biobb_structure_checking/dat/autodock_atomtypes.dat
# The columns describe (from left to right):
# 1. Atom type notation
# 2. Whether the atom is a hydrogen-bond acceptor (i.e. electron-pair donor): 1 (True) or 0 (False)
# 3. Whether the atom is a hydrogen-bond donor (i.e. electron-pair acceptor, that is, a hydrogen
#    atom bonded to an electronegative atom): 1 (True) or 0 (False)
# 4. Type o hydrogen-bond formation: For atoms that are neither an H-bond acceptor or donor, this
#    value is 0. For spherical acceptors/donors it's -1, and for directional acceptors/donors it is
#    equal to the number of H-bonds they can accept/donate.
