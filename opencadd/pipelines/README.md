# OpenCADD Pipelines

This subpackage contains specialized pipelines (each in its own module) for different CADD jobs.


## Pipelines

### `t2fpharm`
[T2F-Pharm](
https://volkamerlab.org/projects/t2f-pharm/
) is a 3D [pharmacophore modelling](
https://volkamerlab.org/research/structure-based/pharmacophores/
) pipeline. More specifically, it is a truly target-focused (TTF â‰¡ T2F) pharmacophore modelling 
tool, which is capable of generating 3D pharmacophores from target protein apo structures alone.

### `t2fflex`
