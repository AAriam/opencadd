**openCADD** is an open-source software for computer-aided drug design.
The aim of openCADD project is to provide a robust and comprehensive toolbox
for facile implementation of computational pipelines in chem- and bioinformatics research.

```{warning}
This project is under active development; some parts are not yet fully implemented, 
and the API of the implemented parts may also change in the future. 
```

## How to Get Started
1. Learn more about openCADD's general features and abilities on the [](getting_started/intro) 
   section, or proceed directly to the [](getting_started/installation) guide.
2. Start with the [User Guide](user_guide/index) for a detailed description of all openCADD's functionalities 
   and how to use them. This part is organized into topic, and follows the along with theoretical background, usage examples,
3. The [API Reference](api_reference/index.md) provides a complete documentation of openCADD's user API.
