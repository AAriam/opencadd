# PDB
The [Protein Data Bank](https://www.wwpdb.org/) (PDB) is the largest database of experimentally determined 
structural data for large biological molecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids, and related complex assemblies. 
It is one of the most comprehensive resources for structural biology, 
hosting data that are crucial for research in many areas of natural sciences, 
including pharmaceutical research and drug discovery. 
As of February 2023, the PDB archive contains detailed information on more than 
214,000 experimentally determined structures, which are deposited to the PDB archive 
by individual researchers around the world, and made freely accessible via the
webservers of the PDB organization's members.



The structural data are commonly obtained by diffraction studies (e.g. X-ray crystallography), 
spectroscopic methods (e.g. nuclear magnetic resonance [NMR]), and more recently, cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM).

*Note:Since October 15, 2006, theoretical models are no longer accepted for deposition. Any
theoretical models deposited prior to this date are archived at
ftp://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/data/structures/models.
