# Input Data

Data plays a critical role in CADD and bioinformatics research. 
Most pipelines rely heavily on some form of input data, 
such as structural data of biologically active molecules; 
sequence data of biological polymers, e.g. nucleic acids and proteins; 
or interaction data, e.g. the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC{sub}`50`).

A typical first step in a CADD pipeline is therefore finding and gathering all the data required
for the specific project at hand. 
Fortunately, many freely accessible online repositories exist, dedicated to collect, organize and supply 
these data. They all provide useful user interfaces accessible through a website, for researchers to 
perform detailed queries on the database, to find and download their needed data. This is a relatively
straightforward task when only some specific data from a certain database is required, but becomes cumbersome 
to carry out manually for larger projects that need large amounts of different data 
and/or data from different resources.

Luckily, most databases also provide full programmatic access to their resources 
through a web application programming interface (API).
