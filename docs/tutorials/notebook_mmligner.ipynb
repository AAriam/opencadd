    "MMLigner (Collier et al., 2017) works by minimizing the ivalue of the alignment. The ivalue is based on\n",
    "the Minimum Message Length framework (Wallace and Boulton, 1968; Wallace, 2005), a Bayesian framework for\n",
    "statistical inductive inference. The ivalue represents the hypothetical minimum message length needed to transmit\n",
    "the computed alignment losslessly (Shannon, 1948).\n",
    "Using the ivalue measure, the algorithm creates crude-but-effective strucural alignments rapidly to act as seeds.\n",
    "These seeds are iteratively refined over an Expectation-Maximization approach using the I-value criterion.\n",
    "By substracting the ivalue from the null model, the statistical significance of the alignment can be computed. If the\n",

    "## What are the  chosen structures\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this project was developed during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic of 2020, we chose the main protease of SARS-Cov from 2006 (2GZ9) and the main protease of SARS-Cov 2 from 2020 (5R8T) as example structures for this tutorial. SARS-Cov and SARS-Cov 2 are strains of viruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The chosen proteases are required for the maturation of SARS-Cov and SARS-Cov 2 respectively, so they make a good target for structure-based drug design of anti-SARS drugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why they have been chosen\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the relevance for the pandemic of 2020, these sructures work well as an example for this tutorial because of their relation to each other resulting in quite similar but not completly similar structures. They both have a length of 306 and, if you align them with Needelman-Wunsch, show a similarity 98.69 % and identity of 96.08 %. The alignment with MMLigner results in a RMSD of 1.244 Å, a coverage of 303 and an ivalue of 29.559 bits."
